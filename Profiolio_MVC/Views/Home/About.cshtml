      <p>Hi, my name is Binh and I currently reside in NSW, Australia. I have over 10 years of experience in software development and have worked for a solutions and services company called Vigilant Video, which is now a Motorola Solutions Company. During my time as a developer at Vigilant Video, I have played a vital role in developing various products using languages such as C++, C#, .Net, ASP.Net, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I am also well-versed in databases like SQL Server, MySQL/MariaDB. Apart from these, I am also familiar with NodeJs, ReactJs, Docker, CI/CD, and Flutter. </p>
          I have been working with the company since its startup days, so I am accustomed to the fast-paced working environment and keep up with it. I am passionate about learning new technologies and consider myself a quick learner. I am always on the lookout for new things and challenges, as I enjoy pushing myself to expand my knowledge and skills. For the details please take a tour to my
